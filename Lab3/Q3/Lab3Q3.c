Exercise 3 :
Find out the highest possible countable time interval using TIMER0, normal mode, and a
suitable pre-scalar. Assume XTAL= 16MHz. What is the selected prescaler? What is the
highest countable time interval?


prescaler=1:1024
TCounterClock=1024 * 1/16
            =64microsec

  max interval =256 x 64=16384 Î¼s =16.384ms

highest countable time interval = 16.384ms
